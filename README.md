Description from Microsoft:

"Site Recovery service: Site Recovery helps ensure business continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running during outages. Site Recovery replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary site to a secondary location. When an outage occurs at your primary site, you fail over to secondary location, and access apps from there. After the primary location is running again, you can fail back to it."

Site recovery replicates:

Azure VMs replicating between Azure regions.
On-premises VMs, Azure Stack VMs and physical servers.
